# CUDA Learning Resources

Welcome to the **CUDA Learning Resources** repository! This is a personal project where I will explore CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), learn how to program with it, and share the resources, code snippets, and tutorials I find useful along the way.

## What is CUDA?
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) developed by NVIDIA. It enables software developers to use the power of NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose computing, providing massive speedups in computation-intensive tasks.

## What's Inside
- Learning materials on CUDA programming
- Code examples and projects
- Step-by-step guides and tutorials
- Helpful links to external resources

Whether you're also just starting out or looking for specific CUDA-related examples, feel free to follow along and contribute to the journey!
